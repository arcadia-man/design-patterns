# **Design Patterns**

## **What is a Design Pattern?**

A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers to solve recurring problems in a way that is efficient, effective, and easily maintainable. A design pattern provides a template for solving a specific problem in a particular context.


## **Advantages of Using Design Patterns**

1. **Code Reusability**: Design patterns provide reusable templates that can be applied to different projects and problems.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: By using patterns, responsibilities are divided clearly between different components, reducing code duplication and complexity.
3. **Improved Communication**: Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers, making communication about software architecture easier.
4. **Better Maintainability**: Patterns help in building systems that are easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
5. **Scalability**: Well-designed systems using design patterns are often easier to scale and adapt to new requirements.

## **Types of Design Patterns**

Design patterns are generally divided into three main categories based on their intent and usage:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**
These patterns deal with the process of object creation and how objects are instantiated.

#### Common Creational Patterns:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### 2. **Structural Patterns**
These patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

#### Common Structural Patterns:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**
These patterns deal with object interaction, responsibility distribution, and communication between objects.

#### Common Behavioral Patterns:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
